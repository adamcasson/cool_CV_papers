# cool_CV_papers
List of computer vision papers I've come across that are cool, interesting, innovative, or all of the above

Repo start date: June 27, 2017

This collection will not be especially retroactive w.r.t. papers I’ve already read unless I pick them up again to study. Nor is it strictly a reflection of the latest and greatest state-of-the-art approaches for CV problems. It’s mostly a working collection of papers that have served a purpose for my research or simply piqued my interest since the start date of this repo.
